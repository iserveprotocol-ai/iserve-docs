# $ISERVE-GOV Token Documentation

## Overview

The $ISERVE-GOV token is an SPL governance token designed to ensure the $ISERVE credential protocol remains a neutral public utility. This token enables decentralized governance of the protocol, allowing token holders to propose and vote on key decisions that shape the future of the ecosystem.

## Token Specifications

* **Name**: ISERVE Governance Token
* **Symbol**: $ISERVE-GOV
* **Standard**: SPL Token with governance extensions
* **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) tokens
* **Decimals**: 9 (Solana standard)
* **Mint Authority**: Governance-controlled multisig

## Token Distribution

The total supply of 1 billion $ISERVE-GOV tokens is allocated as follows:

| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Purpose |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-------|:--------|
| Ecosystem & Community | 40% | 400,000,000 | Incentivizing adoption, community rewards, and ecosystem growth |
| Core Contributors | 20% | 200,000,000 | Compensating the development team and early contributors |
| Treasury | 15% | 150,000,000 | Protocol-owned liquidity and ongoing development funding |
| Investors | 15% | 150,000,000 | Allocated to early investors and strategic partners |
| Public Sale & Liquidity | 10% | 100,000,000 | Public token sale and providing market liquidity |

## Governance Capabilities

The $ISERVE-GOV token enables holders to participate in the governance of the protocol through the following mechanisms:

### 1. Proposal Creation

Token holders with sufficient voting power can create governance proposals for:

* Onboarding new Issuing Authorities to the credential system
* Proposing new credential standards and types
* Protocol upgrades and improvements
* Treasury fund allocations and management
* Parameter adjustments (fees, thresholds, etc.)

### 2. Voting

Token holders can vote on active proposals, with voting power proportional to their token holdings. The voting system uses Solana's native account model with:

* Vote tracking through Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
* Prevention of double-voting through account constraints
* Snapshot functionality for votes at specific slots
* Fair and transparent governance through on-chain verification

### 3. Execution

When proposals pass with sufficient support and quorum, they can be executed to implement the approved changes to the protocol.

## Integration with the Credential System

The $ISERVE-GOV token works alongside the Metaplex NFT credential system to create a complete ecosystem:

### Governance of Credential Issuers

One of the primary governance functions is controlling which entities can become authorized issuers in the credential system. This ensures that only reputable organizations can issue credentials, maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem.

```
Governance Proposal → Vote → Execution → Update Issuer List in Credential Program
```

### Credential Standards Evolution

The governance system allows the community to propose and approve new credential types and metadata standards, ensuring the system evolves to meet emerging needs.

```
Governance Proposal → Vote → Execution → Update Credential Standards
```

### Treasury Management

The governance token controls the protocol treasury, which can fund:

* Development of new features for the credential system
* Grants to organizations building on top of the protocol
* Marketing and adoption initiatives
* Bug bounties and security audits

## Technical Implementation

The $ISERVE-GOV token is implemented using Solana's SPL Token standard with additional governance functionality built using the Anchor framework:

* **SPL Token**: Base token functionality with Associated Token Accounts
* **Token Extensions**: Enhanced features for governance (future upgrade)
* **Program Derived Addresses**: For governance state management and vote tracking
* **Metaplex Token Metadata**: For token metadata and off-chain information

### Key Instructions

#### Token Distribution

```rust
pub fn distribute_tokens(ctx: Context<DistributeTokens>) -> Result<()> {
    let token_distribution = &mut ctx.accounts.token_distribution;
    
    // Ensure distribution hasn't happened yet
    require!(!token_distribution.is_distributed, ErrorCode::AlreadyDistributed);
    
    // Distribute tokens according to allocation plan
    distribute_ecosystem_tokens(&ctx)?;
    distribute_contributor_tokens(&ctx)?;
    distribute_treasury_tokens(&ctx)?;
    distribute_investor_tokens(&ctx)?;
    distribute_public_sale_tokens(&ctx)?;
    
    token_distribution.is_distributed = true;
    token_distribution.distribution_timestamp = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Fund Address Management

```rust
pub fn set_fund_addresses(
    ctx: Context<SetFundAddresses>,
    ecosystem_fund: Pubkey,
    contributors_fund: Pubkey,
    treasury_fund: Pubkey,
    investors_fund: Pubkey,
    public_sale_fund: Pubkey,
) -> Result<()> {
    let fund_config = &mut ctx.accounts.fund_config;

    fund_config.public_sale_fund = public_sale_fund;
    fund_config.is_configured = true;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Governance Functions

```rust
// Delegate voting power
pub fn delegate(ctx: Context<Delegate>, delegatee: Pubkey) -> Result<()> {
    let delegation_account = &mut ctx.accounts.delegation_account;
    delegation_account.delegator = ctx.accounts.delegator.key();
    delegation_account.delegatee = delegatee;
    delegation_account.delegated_at = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
    
    emit!(VotingPowerDelegated {
        delegator: ctx.accounts.delegator.key(),
        delegatee,
        amount: ctx.accounts.token_account.amount,
    });
    
    Ok(())
}

// Get current votes
pub fn get_votes(ctx: Context<GetVotes>) -> Result<u64> {
    let token_account = &ctx.accounts.token_account;
    let delegation_account = &ctx.accounts.delegation_account;
    
    // Check if votes are delegated
    if delegation_account.delegatee != Pubkey::default() {
        // Return delegated voting power
        return Ok(delegation_account.voting_power);
    }
    
    // Return direct token balance
    Ok(token_account.amount)
}

// Get past votes at a specific slot
pub fn get_past_votes(
    ctx: Context<GetPastVotes>,
    slot: u64,
) -> Result<u64> {
    let vote_snapshot = &ctx.accounts.vote_snapshot;
    
    // Find the snapshot for the given slot
    for snapshot in &vote_snapshot.snapshots {
        if snapshot.slot == slot {
            return Ok(snapshot.voting_power);
        }
    }
    
    // Return 0 if no snapshot found for that slot
    Ok(0)
}
```

#### Safety Functions

```rust
// Pause all transfers (emergency only)
pub fn pause_transfers(ctx: Context<PauseTransfers>) -> Result<()> {
    let token_config = &mut ctx.accounts.token_config;
    token_config.transfers_paused = true;
    token_config.paused_at = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
    
    emit!(TransfersPaused {
        paused_by: ctx.accounts.authority.key(),
    });
    
    Ok(())
}

// Unpause transfers
pub fn unpause_transfers(ctx: Context<UnpauseTransfers>) -> Result<()> {
    let token_config = &mut ctx.accounts.token_config;
    token_config.transfers_paused = false;
    token_config.unpaused_at = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
    
    emit!(TransfersUnpaused {
        unpaused_by: ctx.accounts.authority.key(),
    });
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Governance Process

The typical governance process follows these steps:

1. **Proposal Creation**: A token holder creates a proposal with a specific action to be taken
2. **Discussion Period**: The community discusses the proposal in designated forums
3. **Voting Period**: Token holders cast their votes (For, Against, or Abstain)
4. **Execution**: If the proposal passes, it is executed to implement the changes

### Proposal Types

#### Standard Proposals
- Require 1% of total supply to create
- 4% quorum requirement
- 50%+1 majority to pass
- 2-day timelock delay

#### Emergency Proposals
- Require 5% of total supply to create
- 10% quorum requirement
- 67% supermajority to pass
- 6-hour timelock delay

#### Constitutional Proposals
- Require 10% of total supply to create
- 15% quorum requirement
- 75% supermajority to pass
- 7-day timelock delay

## Integration with Solana Ecosystem

### Wallet Integration

The $ISERVE-GOV token is compatible with all major Solana wallets:

* **Phantom**: Native SPL token support with governance UI
* **Solflare**: Full governance functionality and voting interface
* **Backpack**: Token management and delegation features
* **Glow**: DeFi integration and yield farming
* **Slope**: Mobile governance participation

### DeFi Integration

The token can be integrated with Solana's DeFi ecosystem:

* **Jupiter**: Token swapping and price discovery
* **Raydium**: Automated market making and liquidity provision
* **Orca**: Concentrated liquidity pools and yield farming
* **Mango**: Leverage trading and lending protocols
* **Marinade**: Liquid staking integration (future enhancement)

### Example DeFi Integration

```javascript
// Example: Adding liquidity to Jupiter
import { Jupiter, RouteInfo } from '@jup-ag/core';
import { Connection, PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';

async function addLiquidity(wallet, amount) {
    const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
    
    const jupiter = await Jupiter.load({
        connection,
        cluster: 'mainnet-beta',
        user: wallet.publicKey,
    });
    
    // Create liquidity pool for ISERVE-GOV/USDC pair
    const routes = await jupiter.computeRoutes({
        inputMint: ISERVE_GOV_MINT,
        outputMint: USDC_MINT,
        amount: amount,
        slippageBps: 50,
    });
    
    if (routes.routesInfos.length > 0) {
        const { swapTransaction } = await jupiter.exchange({
            routeInfo: routes.routesInfos[0],
        });
        
        const signature = await connection.sendTransaction(swapTransaction, [wallet]);
        return signature;
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

* **Multi-signature Control**: Initial admin functions controlled by a 3-of-5 multisig
* **Gradual Decentralization**: Authority transitions from team to community over time
* **Vote Delegation**: Enables passive holders to participate through active delegates
* **Timelock Protection**: Critical governance actions require waiting periods
* **Emergency Pause**: Ability to pause token transfers in critical situations

## Token Economics

### Utility Mechanisms

1. **Governance Rights**: Voting power proportional to token holdings
2. **Proposal Rights**: Minimum token threshold for creating proposals
3. **Fee Discounts**: Reduced protocol fees for token holders
4. **Treasury Access**: Community control over protocol treasury
5. **Staking Rewards**: Future staking mechanism for additional yield

### Deflationary Mechanisms

1. **Governance Fee Burn**: Small percentage of governance fees burned
2. **Proposal Deposits**: Unsuccessful proposals forfeit deposit tokens
3. **Treasury Buybacks**: Protocol revenue used for token buybacks
4. **Ecosystem Growth**: Increased utility drives token demand

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

* **Quadratic Voting**: Implementing quadratic voting to prevent whale dominance
* **Conviction Voting**: Continuous token-weighted voting with time preference
* **Optimistic Governance**: Faster execution for non-controversial proposals
* **Cross-Chain Governance**: Extending governance to other blockchain networks
* **Liquid Democracy**: Advanced delegation mechanisms with revocation rights
