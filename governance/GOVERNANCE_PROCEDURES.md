  targets: [stakingContractAddress],
  values: [0],
  calldatas: [encodedFunctionCall],
  startBlock: currentBlock + votingDelay,
  endBlock: currentBlock + votingDelay + votingPeriod
};

await governanceContract.submitProposal(
  proposalData.title,
  proposalData.description,
  proposalData.targets,
  proposalData.values,

```javascript
// Vote on proposal
await governanceContract.castVoteWithReason(
  proposalId,
  voteType, // 0=Against, 1=For, 2=Abstain
  "Reason for vote"
);
```

#### Voting Best Practices

```javascript
// Delegate to representative
await governanceToken.delegate(delegateAddress);
```

#### Managing Delegation

- **Regular Review**: Evaluate delegate performance quarterly
- **Communication**: Maintain dialogue with delegate
- **Re-delegation**: Change delegates if performance declines
- **Self-delegation**: Return to self-delegation if preferred

## Emergency Procedures

### Types of Emergencies

- **Transparency**: All emergency actions publicly documented

#### Emergency Procedures
```solidity
// Emergency pause (multisig only)
function emergencyPause() external onlyEmergencyMultisig {
    _pause();
    emit EmergencyPause(msg.sender, block.timestamp);
}

// Emergency parameter change (multisig only)
function emergencyParameterChange(
    string calldata parameter,
    uint256 newValue
) external onlyEmergencyMultisig {
    // Limited parameter changes only
    require(isEmergencyParameter(parameter), "Not emergency parameter");
    _updateParameter(parameter, newValue);
    emit EmergencyParameterChange(parameter, newValue, block.timestamp);
}
```

## Parameter Management

### Governance Parameters

#### Current Parameters Overview
- **Proposal Threshold**: 10M tokens (1% of supply)
- **Quorum Percentage**: 4% of total supply
- **Voting Delay**: ~1 day (6,570 blocks)
- **Voting Period**: ~7 days (46,024 blocks)
- **Timelock Delay**: 2 days (172,800 seconds)

#### Parameter Change Process

1. **Analysis Phase**: Evaluate current parameter effectiveness
2. **Proposal Creation**: Draft parameter change proposal
3. **Community Discussion**: Extended discussion period (14+ days)
4. **Impact Assessment**: Model effects of parameter changes
5. **Governance Vote**: Standard governance process

#### Parameter Change Considerations

**Proposal Threshold**:
- Lower threshold = more proposals, potentially lower quality
- Higher threshold = fewer proposals, potentially more exclusive
- Recommend: Adjust based on token distribution and participation

**Quorum Requirements**:
- Lower quorum = easier to pass proposals, less legitimacy
- Higher quorum = harder to pass proposals, more legitimacy
