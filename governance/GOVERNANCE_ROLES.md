## Overview

The iServe Protocol governance system relies on various roles and responsibilities to ensure effective, secure, and inclusive decision-making. This document outlines the different roles, their responsibilities, requirements, and how individuals can participate in governance.

### Governance Principles
- **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the protocol
